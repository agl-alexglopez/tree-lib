/* All functions labelled ATTRIB_PURE have no side effects and if given the
   same arguments with the same underlying data, produce the same
   return value. Importantly, these cannot be marked with the const attribute
   as str_view points to const char * data which cannot promise to remain
   unchanged even if str_view is a read only type. The str_view only promises
   that it will not alter data not that the program will not alter the string
   data to which a str_view points. The ATTRIB_CONST applies only in rare
   cases where no pointers are accessed or dereferenced. The attributes
   relating to null terminators provide stronger compiler warnings if
   supported to ensure that safe string handling occurs on non null and
   null terminated strings. Credit Harith on Code Review Stack Exchange. */
